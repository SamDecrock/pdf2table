# pdf2table

pdf2table is a node.js library that attempts to extract tables from a pdf.

The 'tables' are extracted as an array of rows.

It uses [pdf2json](https://github.com/modesty/pdf2json) to extract the pdf data.

## Install

You can install __pdf2table__ using the Node Package Manager (npm):

    npm install pdf2table

## Simple example
```js

var pdf2table = require('pdf2table');
var fs = require('fs');

fs.readFile('./test.pdf', function (err, buffer) {
    if (err) return console.log(err);

    pdf2table.parse(buffer, function (err, rows, rowsdebug) {
        if(err) return console.log(err);

        console.log(rows);
    });
});

```
### Getting raw table data
X-axis data is being stripped in the default mode, but may be necessary to reconstruct the table extracted from the pdf. This can be retrieved by passing 'true' as the raw argument, which is false by default.
```
pdf2table.parse(buffer, function, raw = false)
```

## Note
Note that this is a simplistic implementation to extract tables. If your pdf contains other stuff that's not a table, pdf2table will still attempt to shape this data into a row. Feel free to improve and send pull requests.
